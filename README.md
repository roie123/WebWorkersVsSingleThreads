## Overview

Web workers are your secret weapon for achieving parallelism in web development, and Next.js is the perfect framework to harness their power. This repository is your gateway to exploring the benefits of using web workers in a Next.js application.

## Advantages

### üöÄ Faster Computations

Offload CPU-intensive tasks to web workers, ensuring your web app remains responsive during heavy computations.

### üåê Improved Network Requests

Perform network requests in the background, preventing blocking and allowing your app to remain interactive.

### üíª Parallel Processing

Leverage multi-core CPUs by running tasks concurrently, reducing processing time and enhancing overall performance.

### üîí Enhanced Security

Run potentially unsafe code within a web worker sandbox, protecting your main application from malicious activities.

### üì¶ Modularization

Encapsulate functionality in separate workers, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
